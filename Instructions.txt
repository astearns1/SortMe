I am going to be completely honest up front. I have tried figuring out how to run
the program in a command line and I cannot figure out the error that is occuring.
Below will be the method I have found in multiple locations of how to run a java program
in a command line, but it has not worked for me. I am very unfamiliar with trying to run
a program in this way and worked on trying to find a solution for the better part
of 3 hours. I tried a couple different ways from the internet and nothing wanted to run.
I hope this works well as an attempt and you (Mr. Clay) or Dr. Wong will be able to provide 
guidance/suggestions in the future. I want to learn and understand how it works but it has 
just been really frustrating so far.

UPDATED:
I figured out how to get it to work in Powershell which will be the instructions provided
below. I cannot get my ubuntu to work and navigate around in it. So hopefully this will
work for now until I can learn more about Ubuntu and how to work it. 

UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open command line program
2. Set cd to the folder where the SortMe.java & Sort Me.txt file are located together
3. Type javac SortMe.java
	(This will create some .class files with the same name as your .java file)
4. Make a new folder called "sortme" in your current cd location and 
	move the .class files into this folder
5. Type java sortme.SortMe
	(This should be followed by the output of the java file which is the sorted names)
